= Textures =
Credit for textures go to: fogleman's Craft (https://github.com/fogleman/Craft), the OCD texture pack for minecraft (https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/ocd-pack/), and the plastic texture pack for minecraft xbox-360 (https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Minecraft-Plastic-Texture-Pack/81834c2c-9a04-4bdb-adc5-4d8399e99bc7). All textures included in this repository were created by myself, but I used the texture atlas created in fogleman's Craft, and I drew heavy inspiration from the OCD and pastic texture packs referenced above.
